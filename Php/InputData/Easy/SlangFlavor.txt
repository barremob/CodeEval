A tendency to a paradoxical manner of statement is also observable. Let us try to amuse ourselves, old boys as we are, by moulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state.
Arms and the materials of war are to be imported and exported only with the consent of the generals, and then only by the state.
Yes to them far above all others.
There is less arrangement in them, and the transitions are more abrupt from one subject to another. Robbery of temples at Athens was punished by death, refusal of burial in the land, and confiscation of property! Now I am afraid of appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very small materials.
Impossible. That is certainly true. Let me remind you of a tie which unites you to Crete.
There was a resemblance also in more important matters. Every magistrate is a judge, and every judge is a magistrate, on the day on which he is deciding the suit.
The final judgment in all cases shall rest with the court of appeal.
And now shall we call in our colonists and make a speech to them. For the serious implies the ludicrous, and opposites cannot be understood without opposites. Is there not one claim of authority which is always just, - that of fathers and mothers and in general of progenitors to rule over their offspring! The laws relating to marriage naturally come first, and therefore we may begin with them.
Human affairs are hardly serious, and yet a sad necessity compels us to be serious about them.
In the Laws, we remark a change in the place assigned by him to pleasure and pain. What would you like! In the Laws, as in the Sophist and Statesman, we pass out of the region of metaphysical or transcendental ideas into that of psychology.
One. Two. Three. Four! Five. Six. Seven. Eight! Nine? Ten?
If a slave be put out of the way to prevent his informing of some crime, his death shall be punished like that of a citizen! This was one of the unjust principles of government which we mentioned when speaking of the different claims to rule. The individual follows reason, and the city law, which is embodied reason, either derived from the Gods or from the legislator. But, as time advanced and the race multiplied, the world came to be what the world is.
Surely, that of the better soul. But where shall we find the magistrate who is worthy to supervise them or look into their short-comings and crooked ways.
Next, as to the reception of strangers!
But to arrive at them we must begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case of those who may have happened to die intestate. But there is another equality, of a better and higher kind, which is not so easily recognized. No mention occurs in the Laws of the doctrine of Ideas.
The receiver of stolen goods shall undergo the same punishment as the thief. In what other manner could we ever study the art of self-defence. And now, what is this city.
If a stranger unintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city, he who likes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules. Is the approval of gods and men to be deemed good and honourable, but unpleasant, and their disapproval the reverse!
Three kinds of officers will thus have to be appointed, in order that the city may be suitably provided according to her needs. Would not this have been the way? Similar principles are applied to inferior offices. We must, therefore, endeavour to divide to the best of our power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser.
I have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodies and generous souls. And this sin, which is termed dishonesty, is to the soul what disease is to the body, what pestilence is to the seasons, what injustice is to states.
Certainly.
Every man should be true and single-minded, and should not allow himself to be deceived by others. Certainly. The soul undergoes many changes from her contact with bodies and all that the player does is to put the pieces into their right places.
The scheme of education in the Laws is of a far lower kind than that which Plato had conceived in the Republic.
Nothing as yet but I ask generally, when the puppet is brought to the drink, what sort of result is likely to follow. Theft is a mean, and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sons of Zeus delight in fraud and violence, or ever practised either? Proceed. Which will you take.
Yet there are many traces of advance as well as retrogression in the Laws of Plato! Who are they, and what is their nature. For my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell, and yet I have a confidence which makes me go on! They were to be trained in the use of arms, they are to live in public.
In the first place, all the citizens shall select candidates from the first class and they shall be compelled to vote under pain of a fine. In my opinion, Cleinias, the ancient legislators were too good-natured, and made laws without sufficient observation or consideration of human things. And if we wish for any others, I say that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperience of the lives which actually exist? For escaping or for capturing an enemy, quickness of foot is required but hand-to-hand conflict and combat need vigour and strength.
Philosophy fades away into the distance in the Laws it is confined to the members of the Nocturnal Council. What do you mean. Now the legislator should determine what is to be the limit of poverty or wealth.
There let it lie and so leaving it to lie, we will proceed to the dances of war and peace, for with these we are undoubtedly concerned. And the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the soul, we have ventured to term music. Very true, Megillus and you must join with me in detaining him. Then now, my friend, let us observe what will happen in the constitution of out intended state!
Clearly the self-moving for there could be no change in them arising out of any external cause the change must first take place in themselves. Both in Plato and Athenian law, as in modern times, the accomplice of a crime is to be punished as well as the principal. Very greatly.
Sacrilege. Two remedies alone remain to us, - not to have the slaves of the same country, nor if possible, speaking the same language (compare Aris.
Education has two branches - gymnastic, which is concerned with the body and music, which improves the soul. At least, if any further changes are required, the magistrates must take the whole people into counsel, and obtain the sanction of all the oracles.
In the Republic, Plato is flying in the air regardless of fact and possibility - in the Laws, he is making history by analogy. This shall be the business of the first day!
Now that God has instructed us in the arts of legislation, there is no merit in seeing all this, or in learning wisdom after the event. Excellent harbours, Stranger there could not be better. They must consider also in what sense they are one! By all means, if Heaven wills.
Are they not strivers for mastery in the greatest of combats.
There will not! Let us acknowledge, then, that we have a preamble.
Must not he who maintains that the Gods can be propitiated argue thus. Certainly.
I think that I have clearly stated in the former part of the discussion, but if I did not, let me now state. Some one may ask this very question, and quite rightly, too. In the election of the Boule, Plato again attempts to mix aristocracy and democracy? For you would surely not send a general invitation to all Hellas.
For when evils are far gone and irremediable, the task of censuring them is never pleasant, although at times necessary. The reign of Cronos has passed away, and various forms of government have succeeded, which are all based on self-interest and self-preservation. Next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse contests! Certainly.
Let us now return to the enactment of laws.
Your arguments seem to prove your point. This is often a troublesome business, but in theory we may suppose the operation performed, and the desired purity attained. And we join in the prayers of our friends, and ask for them what they ask for themselves.
These objects should be attended to at the foundation of the city!
