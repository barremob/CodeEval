Just some CodeEval tests

- C# and C++ with Visual Studio 2015
- PHP Eclipse PHP Mars

I try to add the test results in the source code file itself.
But don't really think there is any added value to these results.
Because I have seen different results with exactly the same code, but on different days.

As a side note, I sometimes write dirty code.
When the points are higher than 30 I don't even bother of optimizing at the moment.
Maybe when there are no more tests to do I revisit some and try better.

In the end you won't get much better results, because an empty test has already 4.7Mb memory.
And you won't get much better than that, or change to c++.
